# octac-docs

LaTeX source for a technical book documenting the design of OctaC, a statically typed, C-structured language for numerical and matrix computation, built as part of a Compiler Construction course.

---

## Overview

The book documents the OctaC language specification and the compiler built to implement it, growing chapter by chapter as the formal grammar, lexer, parser, semantic analysis, and code generation are added.

The text is currently organized into one part:

- Part I: Language Design: the OctaC specification, with grammar, lexer, parser, semantic analysis, and code generation chapters to follow

---

## Repository layout

- `*.tex`: chapter source files (e.g. `chp01-specification.tex`)
- `build/`: intermediate files produced during compilation
- `Makefile`: build rules (produces `book.pdf`)

---

## Build (quickstart)

Requirements (Ubuntu/Debian):

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y texlive-latex-extra latexmk
```

Build the book:

```bash
make
```

Clean intermediate files:

```bash
make clean
```
